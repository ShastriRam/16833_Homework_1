Jack's Notes about making particle maps

At startup, process the map so that we are left with just edge pixels of the traversable region.
There are about 5600 edge pixels for this map.  


When making a range map for a particle:
	* Adjust the particle's position +25cm in the look direction
	* Eliminate all edges that are greater than desired range away in X & Y   (only use edges within a square 2x range around the edge pixel)
	* Find angle and distance to each remaining edge pixel.
	* Remove edge pixels less than -95 and greater than 95 degrees from the look direction.  
	* For each range measurement:
		- Extract all pixels within +/- 10 degrees of the beam direction.
		- Rotate the pixels so that they are centered around 0 degrees
		- For each remaining edge, find the Y coordinate
		- Use the closest edge that is within 5cm of 0.
