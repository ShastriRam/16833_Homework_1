Jack's Notes:




At startup, process the map so that we are left with just edge pixels of the traversable region.
There are about 4000 edge pixels for this map.  


When making a range map for a particle:
	* Adjust the particle's position +25cm in the look direction
	* Eliminate all edges that are greater than desired range away in X & Y   (only use edges within a square 2x range around the edge pixel)
	* Find angle and distance to each remaining edge pixel.
	* Remove edge pixels less than -95 and greater than 95 degrees from the look direction.  
	* For each range measurement:
		- Extract all pixels within 10 degrees of the beam direction.
		- Rotate the pixels so that they are centered around 0 degrees
		- For each remaining edge, find the Y coordinate
		- Use the closest edge that is within 5cm of 0.
